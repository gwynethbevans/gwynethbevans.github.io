    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      A behavioral science-driven marketing creative with a recently completed Bachelor's degree in Economics and a minor in Psychology from Swarthmore College, along with coursework through the University of Pennsylvania. I bring hands-on experience in marketing, research, operations, and leadership—rooted in an analytical mindset and a passion for using behavioral insights to make a measurable impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      At NeuroFlow, I developed content and marketing materials for digital mental health initiatives, including nationwide campaign calendars, B2B and B2C toolkits, and digital CBT (dCBT) program summaries. My work supported efforts to scale personalized mental health support through compelling, insight-driven communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m eager to expand my experience into other areas of marketing—such as market analysis, research, and coordination—that align with my strengths and interests in data analysis, behavioral science, and strategic operations. I thrive at the intersection of research and creativity, and I’m excited to continue building thoughtful, outcome-driven solutions across sectors.
